Hello,
I have uploaded my URL to download UbuntuMac, the promised modified version of Ubuntu that is compatible with Macs from 1998-Present, 
i Have been working on this for 20 days now, just copy and paste the URL  and download the file.
You have to download Balena Etcher and Flash to a drive with 3gb or more, then plug it in to your Mac and hold Options,
when you enter macOS Utilities, hit the down arrow and select the drive with the USB logo on it.
When you first boot into UbuntuMac, it is basically the same setup as Ubuntu, but with macOS Utilities,
When you install it, you have to select the unallocated space and then allocate the disk space on your Mac,
then you have to select the entire disk, then Install, otherwise there is a 99% chance that it will not work.
Good Luck! Enjoy! I will start working on the FreeBSD then the Windows as promised, I will upload an updated README every time
we change something, as of now, we will launch FreeBSD for Mac sometime next week, and Windows in late June-July
